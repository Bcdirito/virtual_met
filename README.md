# Virtual Met

created by [Chris Webber](https://github.com/christopherweber) and [Brian DiRito](https://github.com/bcdirito)

Virtual Met is a single-page Vanilla JavaScript application with a Ruby on Rails backend

Take procured tours of the Met 5th Ave Museum with the Virtual Met. With accompanying music, access to the Met's database, and already predetermined works, you can browse through up to six departments!

## How it Works:
  1. Navigate to the backend directory and boot up the server by entering "rails s".

  2. Once the server is up and running, navigate to the frontend directory and enter "open index.html"

  3. If all is well and good, you should be able to take the tours!
  
## Additional Notes:
  1. Music works best if you listen with headphones.
  
  2. If viewing in full-page, do note that clicking on "Learn More" opens another tab in your browser. Make sure to close the tab and not the window.
